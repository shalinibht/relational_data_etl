Relational Database ETL

This is my project work for loading Hotel data from CSV file to MySQL database. At different stages of transformation, I am using different database to store my intermedidate work.

1. Initially, I have loaded entire table into a MySQL database using Google Cloud MySQL data import utility.
2. Then I have normalized the table data into multiple table so that its easier to query and not redundant.
3. I am working on transformations to make data much cleaner and consistent.
4. My target state to move this to Stored Procedure.
5. Final stage of the project will be a fully automated ETL process for loading this dataset.
